# ☕ Java DSA & Design Patterns Solutions

A comprehensive repository where I document my solutions to classic Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA) problems and implementations of fundamental Design Patterns using Java.

## 📖 About This Repository

This project is my personal journey through the world of computer science fundamentals. It's a hands-on lab where I practice, implement, and refine solutions to a wide range of problems. The goal is to build a solid foundation in DSA and software design principles, one commit at a time.

This repository serves two main purposes:
1.  **A Personal Knowledge Base:** A place to store and organize my work for future reference.
2.  **A Community Resource:** A helpful guide for students, self-taught developers, and anyone looking to brush up on their Java-based problem-solving skills.

## 🗂️ Repository Structure

The repository is organized into two main directories to keep things clean and easy to navigate:

* `DataStructuresAndAlgorithms`: This folder contains implementations of various data structures and solutions to algorithmic problems. Each topic has its own sub-directory.
    ```
    /DataStructuresAndAlgorithms
    ├── /Arrays
    │   ├── TwoSum.java
    │   └── ...
    ├── /LinkedLists
    │   ├── ReverseLinkedList.java
    │   └── ...
    ├── /Trees
    │   └── ...
    └── /Sorting
        └── ...
    ```

* `DesignPatterns`: This folder contains Java implementations of the Gang of Four (GoF) design patterns.
    ```
    /DesignPatterns
    ├── /Creational
    │   ├── /Singleton
    │   │   └── Singleton.java
    │   └── /Factory
    │       └── ...
    ├── /Structural
    │   └── ...
    └── /Behavioral
        └── ...
    ```
